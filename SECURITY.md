# üîí Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

Vaulto is designed with security as the top priority. This document outlines our security practices, how to report vulnerabilities, and what users can expect from our security measures.

## üîê Security Features

### Encryption & Data Protection

- **AES-256 Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted using industry-standard AES-256
- **SQLCipher Database**: Local database is fully encrypted with SQLCipher
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: Master passwords are hashed using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Android Keystore**: Cryptographic keys are stored in Android's secure hardware keystore
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Only you have access to your decrypted data

### Authentication & Access Control

- **Master Password**: Strong master password requirement (minimum 8 characters)
- **Biometric Authentication**: Fingerprint and face unlock support
- **Auto-Lock**: Configurable auto-lock timer (immediate to never)
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with automatic timeout

### Application Security

- **Offline-First**: No network access required, data stays on device
- **Code Obfuscation**: Release builds use ProGuard/R8 for code protection
- **Root Detection**: Warnings for rooted devices (optional)
- **Screenshot Prevention**: Sensitive screens protected from screenshots
- **App Backgrounding**: Content hidden when app goes to background

## üö® Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| 0.9.x   | ‚úÖ Yes (until 2025-06-01) |
| 0.8.x   | ‚ùå No              |
| < 0.8   | ‚ùå No              |

## üêõ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### üö® IMPORTANT: Do NOT create public issues for security vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

### üìß Contact Information

   - Clear explanation of the vulnerability
   - Potential impact and severity assessment
   - Affected versions or components

2. **Reproduction Steps**
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
   - Required conditions or configurations
   - Screenshots or proof-of-concept (if safe)

3. **Environment Information**
   - Android version and device model
   - App version and build information
   - Any relevant system configurations

4. **Suggested Mitigation**
   - Proposed fixes or workarounds
   - Timeline considerations
   - Backward compatibility concerns

### üîÑ Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** (within 48 hours)
   - Confirmation of receipt
   - Initial assessment
   - Timeline for investigation

2. **Investigation** (1-7 days)
   - Vulnerability verification
   - Impact assessment
   - Fix development planning

3. **Resolution** (varies by severity)
   - Security patch development
   - Testing and validation
   - Release preparation

4. **Disclosure** (coordinated)
   - Public disclosure timeline
   - Credit to reporter (if desired)
   - Security advisory publication

## üèÜ Security Hall of Fame

We recognize security researchers who help improve Vaulto's security:

*No vulnerabilities reported yet - be the first!*

### Recognition Criteria

- **Responsible disclosure** followed
- **Valid security impact** confirmed
- **Constructive reporting** provided
- **Coordinated timeline** respected

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices for Users

### üîê Master Password

- **Use a strong, unique password** (12+ characters recommended)
- **Include mixed case, numbers, and symbols**
- **Don't reuse** passwords from other services
- **Consider using a passphrase** for better memorability
- **Never share** your master password

### üì± Device Security

- **Keep your device updated** with latest Android security patches
- **Use device lock screen** (PIN, pattern, biometric)
- **Avoid rooted devices** for maximum security
- **Install apps** only from trusted sources
- **Regular backups** of your encrypted vault

### üîí App Security

- **Enable auto-lock** with appropriate timeout
- **Use biometric unlock** if available and desired
- **Regular app updates** for security patches
- **Backup your vault** regularly to secure location
- **Review app permissions** periodically

## üö´ Security Limitations

### Known Limitations

1. **Device Compromise**: If your device is compromised by malware, Vaulto cannot protect against keyloggers or screen capture
2. **Physical Access**: If someone has physical access to your unlocked device, they may access Vaulto
3. **Backup Security**: Exported backups are only as secure as where you store them
4. **Biometric Bypass**: Some devices may have biometric vulnerabilities outside our control

### Out of Scope

The following are generally considered out of scope for security reports:

- **Social engineering attacks**
- **Physical device access** scenarios
- **Operating system vulnerabilities**
- **Hardware-level attacks**
- **Denial of service** through resource exhaustion
- **Issues requiring rooted devices**

## üîç Security Audits

### Internal Security Measures

- **Regular code reviews** with security focus
- **Automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning**
- **Static analysis** for security issues
- **Penetration testing** of critical components

### External Audits

- **Third-party security audits** planned for major releases
- **Bug bounty program** under consideration
- **Community security reviews** welcomed
- **Academic research** collaboration encouraged
